# Machine Learning Applications to Chemical Stuff

This repository contains my trials of applying machine learning to chemical
stuff. This branch currently deals with my trials applying these techniques to
some fluid flow problems (hopefully ending with applications to shocks and
non-equilibrium type flows). Hopefully this will also tie back in to the bigger
picture of applications to chemical kinetics. This document should include some
description of the code files in here.
